# Drone-Detection-using-YOLOv8n
A Drone Detection and Localization Model using Yolov8n on a larger dataset.
<br>
YOLOv8n is the smallest and fastest variant of the YOLOv8 family, designed for high-speed object detection on edge devices.
<br>
In this project, YOLOv8n model was trained on a custom dataset to detect drones, people, vehicles, and birds in real time. Its anchor-free architecture and improved accuracy make it highly efficient for deployment on low-power hardware like the Raspberry Pi, enabling fast and reliable drone surveillance.
